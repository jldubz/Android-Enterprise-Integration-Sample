# Android-Enterprise-Integration-Sample

This application was developed as a sample application for the LinkedIn Learning/Lynda.com course [Android App Development: Enterprise Integration](https://www.lynda.com/Android-tutorials/Android-App-Development-Enterprise-Integration/651198-2.html) and demonstrates how to integrate key enterprise integration features such as lock-task mode and managed configurations.

When developing Android applications for enterprise, security is paramount. Applications need to be able to integrate with existing mobile device management (MDM) systems-which companies rely on to control access to their data. Offering enterprise integration options can open untapped opportunities for your apps. This course shows you how to leverage your existing Android development skills and build apps for this valuable market.

Instructor Jon-Luke West first reviews the key concepts of enterprise mobility management in Android: important APIs, the role of the device administrator, and the types of devices you should plan to target. He reviews the three primary use cases, including bring your own device (BYOD) and corporate-owned single-use (COSU) scenarios. Then he dives straight into the code, showing how to implement three enterprise integration features: managed application configurations, app pinning, and locked task mode. Finally, he shows how to test the features on a managed device.

Topics include:
* Enterprise mobility management (EMM) and mobile device management (MDM)
* Android EMM APIs
* Use cases: BYOD, work-manage devices, and COSU
* Checking restrictions and restriction changes for managed configurations
* App pinning and lock task mode
* Testing enterprise integration features using Test DPC
